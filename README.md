**A three-tier architecture-diagram**

[arch design](https://github.com/jaeger231/Architecture-diagrams/blob/35b9e55ba14e45670c577f67293e94f61a9e4639/my%201.PNG)

The architecture for this e-commerce platform is designed to meet the requirements for high availability, low latency, security, fault tolerance, and cost efficiency, while also ensuring the protection of data both at rest and in transit. This setup is divided into three primary tiers—Web Tier, Application Tier, and Data Tier

**Web Tier**

● **Amazon Route 53:** This managed DNS service routes customer requests to the closest AWS region. Route 53 improves latency by directing traffic to the geographically nearest AWS endpoint, enhancing user experience for African customers. 

● **Amazon CloudFront:** Integrated with Route 53, CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that caches static content, like product images, across edge locations worldwide. This reduces latency for static content delivery and offloads traffic from backend services. 

● **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deployed in front of CloudFront, WAF protects against SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other web attacks. It strengthens the application’s security by filtering out potentially harmful traffic before it reaches the backend services. 

● **Amazon Cognito:** This service handles user authentication, allowing customers to sign in securely and access the application. Cognito integrates with IAM to enforce granular access policies.
Application Tier 

● **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) - Multi-AZ:** The load balancer distributes incoming traffic evenly across multiple instances within an Auto Scaling Group, located in multiple Availability Zones (AZs). This ensures high availability and fault tolerance by rerouting traffic if an instance or AZ goes down. 

● **Auto Scaling Group (ASG):** The ASG automatically scales the EC2 instances up or down based on traffic load, optimizing resource usage and cost. It ensures that the application can handle high traffic spikes while minimizing costs during low traffic periods. 

● **Amazon API Gateway:** This service acts as a managed API layer, exposing microservices within the application tier to the web tier. It provides controlled access to the business logic and integrates with Lambda functions to run lightweight tasks in a serverless environment, optimizing costs. 

● **AWS Fargate:** Fargate provides serverless compute for containers, hosting the business logic as microservices. It removes the need to manage EC2 instances, making it cost-effective for dynamic workloads. Containers communicate securely within the VPC. 

● **ElasticCache:** Amazon ElastiCache provides an in-memory cache layer that reduces the latency for frequently accessed data, such as user sessions and popular product information. This is crucial for improving user experience by providing quick data retrieval. 

● **EFS (Elastic File System):** Amazon EFS serves as shared storage across multiple containers in Fargate, providing a seamless experience for microservices that require shared files or stateful data. EFS charges only for used storage, making it cost-efficient.
Data Tier 

● **Amazon Aurora (RDS):** Aurora provides a highly available, managed relational database to store transactional data (e.g., customer information, orders, and payment history). It’s configured for high availability with Multi-AZ deployment, ensuring minimal downtime. 

● **Aurora Read Replicas (RDS Slave):** This replica offloads read traffic from the primary database, which enhances performance for read-heavy workloads without impacting the primary database’s performance. 

● **Key Management Service (KMS):** KMS secures data at rest by managing the encryption keys for Aurora and EFS, ensuring compliance with security standards.


**Monitoring, Logging, and Security** 

● **AWS GuardDuty:** GuardDuty continuously monitors for suspicious activity, detecting potential security threats (e.g., unauthorized access, anomalous API calls). It provides alerts, allowing the security team to respond to incidents. 

● **CloudWatch and FlowLogs:** CloudWatch gathers performance metrics and logs for each component in the architecture. It monitors CPU usage, memory, error rates, and other metrics, while VPC FlowLogs record IP traffic for network analysis and security audits. 

● **CloudTrail:** CloudTrail logs API calls across the AWS environment, enabling auditing, compliance monitoring, and troubleshooting for any configuration or access changes 

**How the architecture works** 

Step-by-step walkthrough of how this architecture works, from the perspective of a user accessing the e-commerce application to how the backend processes and stores data.


**1. User Access and Edge Layer** 

● **User Interaction:** Users access the e-commerce application from their devices (desktop, mobile, tablet) using a browser. 

● **Amazon Route 53:** When a user enters the application's URL, Amazon Route 53 directs the user’s request to the appropriate AWS region in Africa, ensuring low latency. 

● **Amazon CloudFront:** After DNS resolution, CloudFront, a Content Delivery Network (CDN), caches and serves static content (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript) from the nearest edge location. This minimizes the load on backend servers and reduces latency for users. 

● **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** WAF filters incoming traffic, blocking malicious requests and attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting) before they reach the backend. Only legitimate requests pass through to the load balancer.

**2. Authentication and Security** 

● **Amazon Cognito:** If the user needs to log in, Cognito handles user authentication. It provides secure sign-in and sign-up options, allowing users to create accounts and access personalized features. Cognito integrates with Identity and Access Management (IAM) for permissions management and can authenticate users with third-party providers if necessary.

**3. Web Tier (Public Subnet)**

● **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):** The WAF-approved requests are forwarded to the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) in the public subnet. The ELB balances the load by distributing incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances in the private subnets (inside the Auto Scaling Group). This setup ensures high availability and fault tolerance. The ELB operates in multiple Availability Zones (AZs), ensuring that if one AZ fails, the application remains accessible. 

● **Auto Scaling Group (ASG):** The ASG automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand. During peak hours, the ASG launches additional instances to handle high traffic, and during off-peak times, it scales down to save costs.

**4. Application Tier (Private Subnet)** 

● **Amazon API Gateway:** For requests that require dynamic content or interaction with the business logic, the load balancer forwards requests to the Amazon API Gateway. API Gateway exposes APIs and endpoints for the backend microservices, allowing clients to securely access business logic. 

● **ElasticCache:** To reduce latency and improve performance, frequently accessed data, such as session data and popular products, are stored in Amazon ElastiCache. This caching layer reduces the load on the backend database by handling repeated read requests more quickly. 

● **Amazon EFS (Elastic File System):** EFS is used for shared storage across Fargate containers, ensuring that data required by multiple services (like uploaded product images or shared files) is accessible to all containers within the VPC. 

● **AWS Fargate (Microservices):** The core business logic is broken into microservices and hosted on AWS Fargate containers in private subnets. Fargate is a serverless container service, meaning the infrastructure management is handled by AWS, and it scales automatically based on workload. 
      
**Example Microservices:** Product Catalog, Order Management, User Profiles, and Payment Processing are examples of microservices hosted on Fargate. Each service runs independently, enabling better scalability, fault tolerance, and isolation of different application components. 
      
**Role of Fargate in the Architecture**

In this architecture, Fargate is used in the **application tier** to host containerized microservices responsible for handling the core business logic of the e-commerce platform. Here’s a breakdown of its purpose: 

**a. Microservices Deployment**: The application is broken down into microservices, where each microservice handles a specific aspect of the e-commerce functionality. It provides an isolated, secure environment to run these microservices in separate containers. 

**b. Serverless Container Management:** Fargate eliminates the need to manage EC2 instances by automatically provisioning the required compute resources. Each container is executed on its own Fargate instance with the appropriate amount of CPU and memory, based on the configuration set. This significantly reduces operational overhead, as no manual provisioning, scaling, or patching of the underlying infrastructure is required. 

**c. Auto-Scaling and High Availability:** Fargate automatically scales up or down based on demand. In case of increased traffic, additional Fargate tasks (containers) are launched to handle the load. When demand decreases, Fargate scales back down, minimizing costs. Since the Fargate instances are deployed across multiple Availability Zones, it ensures high availability and fault tolerance for the application tier. 

**d. Cost Optimization:** With Fargate’s serverless model, you only pay for the resources that are actually used by the containers. This pay-as-you-go pricing makes it cost-effective, especially for applications with variable workloads. This helps the e-commerce platform meet its budget requirements while still achieving scalability and performance. 

**Leveraging Fargate to the Architecture’s Advantage** 

**Decoupling Microservices:** Fargate allows each microservice to operate independently. For example, one container may handle order processing, while another handles product recommendations. This setup reduces interdependencies between services and allows each service to scale individually based on demand, leading to efficient resource usage and lower costs. 

**Enhanced Security:** Fargate runs in private subnets, keeping it isolated from the public internet. Combined with security groups, IAM roles, and encryption, Fargate provides a secure environment that protects data in transit and at rest, which is crucial for e-commerce applications handling sensitive customer information. 

**Simplified Management and Maintenance:** Since Fargate is a managed service, there’s no need to worry about server maintenance, patching, or scaling the underlying infrastructure. This allows the team to focus on developing features and improving the application, as AWS handles the heavy lifting of infrastructure management. 

**Cost-Effective Scaling:** Fargate’s pay-as-you-go pricing model ensures cost efficiency. During peak usage, additional Fargate tasks are automatically deployed to handle the increased load. When traffic decreases, Fargate scales down, resulting in cost savings by not paying for idle resources. 

**Fault Tolerance and High Availability:** Fargate tasks can be distributed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a region. Combined with the ELB’s multi-AZ capability, Fargate ensures that the application remains highly available, even if one AZ encounters issues. This configuration is essential for maintaining a resilient e-commerce platform. 

**Supports CI/CD Pipelines:** Fargate can be integrated with CI/CD tools (e.g., AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy) to support continuous deployment. This setup allows the development team to quickly deploy new features or bug fixes to Fargate containers, ensuring that updates reach users with minimal delay.

**5. Data Tier (Private Subnet)** 

● **Amazon Aurora (Primary Database):** The application’s main database is Amazon Aurora, a high-performance managed database solution. Aurora stores relational data like customer profiles, order histories, and payment records. It’s deployed across multiple AZs for high availability. 

● **Aurora Read Replica (RDS Slave):** The read replica offloads read-heavy requests from the primary Aurora database. This is especially useful for handling high volumes of product browsing or user queries without affecting the primary database’s performance. 

● **Key Management Service (KMS):** KMS encrypted sensitive data at rest in both Aurora and EFS, ensuring secure data storage. This encryption meets compliance requirements and protects user data against unauthorized access.


**6. Outbound Internet Access (Public Subnet)**

● **NAT Gateway:** The application’s backend resources in private subnets, such as Fargate containers and EC2 instances, sometimes need access to the internet (e.g., for updates, external API calls, or integrations). The NAT Gateway provides this outbound internet access securely, without exposing the resources to inbound internet traffic.

**7. Data Storage and Content Delivery** 

● **Amazon S3:** Product images and other static assets are stored in S3, a cost-effective storage solution with high durability and availability. S3 integrates with CloudFront for fast delivery, caching images at the edge locations nearest to users, improving page load times.

**8. CloudFormation for Infrastructure Automation** 

● **AWS CloudFormation:** The entire infrastructure is automated using CloudFormation, which allows for rapid provisioning, scaling, and updating of resources. CloudFormation templates enable quick replication of this setup in different environments (e.g., development, staging, and production) 

**Leveraging AWS Lambda and Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) (Fully managed services)** 

**AWS Lambda** 

This is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. You upload your code, and Lambda handles everything required to run and scale it with high availability. In the context of this architecture, Lambda can serve several purposes: 

**Event-Driven Microservices:** Lambda can run specific parts of the business logic for event-driven tasks. This is particularly useful in a microservices architecture where different services may need to perform independent tasks based on events. 

**Automatic Scaling and Cost-Effectiveness:** Since Lambda scales automatically in response to incoming requests, it is highly cost-effective, as you only pay for the compute time that you actually use. This means that it can handle unexpected spikes in traffic without requiring pre-provisioned infrastructure.

**1. Integration with SQS:** Lambda can be set up to poll messages from an SQS queue, process those messages, and perform necessary tasks. This setup is useful for tasks that don’t need to be executed synchronously with the main user request (e.g., generating reports, resizing images, processing order confirmations).
**2. Data Processing and Transformation:** Lambda is well-suited for processing and transforming data in real-time. For example, if a new product is added to the inventory, a Lambda function could process and format that data before storing it in the database or caching layer. 

**Amazon SQS** 

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that allows microservices and distributed systems to communicate in a reliable, asynchronous way. SQS decouples components of an application, ensuring that messages (events, requests) are delivered and processed without losing data.

**1. Decoupling Components:** SQS allows you to decouple the components of your application, such as the frontend, API Gateway, Lambda functions, and database. By using SQS, different components can operate independently, enhancing system resilience and reducing latency for critical tasks.

**2. Reliable Message Processing:** SQS ensures that messages are delivered at least once, so even if a Lambda function fails while processing a message, SQS will retain it until it’s successfully processed. This guarantees that tasks are completed and data is not lost, which is especially important for tasks like order processing and payment handling.

**3. Handling Asynchronous Workloads:** For tasks that don’t need immediate execution or that could benefit from being processed in batches, SQS can queue these tasks to be handled later. For example, if the application needs to send order confirmation emails or update a database asynchronously, the API Gateway or application tier can send messages to SQS, and Lambda functions can process them later. 

**How Lambda and SQS Work Together in This Architecture** 

Lambda and SQS can work in tandem to optimize the architecture’s performance and reliability. Here are a few scenarios that illustrate their collaboration and benefits within this e-commerce architecture:

**1. Order Processing Pipeline**

● When a user places an order, the frontend application (via API Gateway) sends the order details to an SQS queue. 

● Lambda functions configured to poll the SQS queue can retrieve and process these order messages. They might handle tasks such as verifying inventory, processing payments, and creating order entries in the database. 

● This decoupling allows the application to respond to the user quickly after placing an order, while the actual order processing happens asynchronously in the background. This enhances the user experience by reducing wait times.

**2. Notification and Alerting System** 

● When certain events occur, such as successful order processing, shipping updates, or low stock alerts, SQS can be used to queue notifications. 

● Lambda functions can then process these messages from SQS to send real-time notifications to users via email, SMS, or push notifications. 

● This setup ensures that notifications are sent reliably without blocking other parts of the system. Even if there’s a surge in orders, the notifications are queued and sent as Lambda functions process the queue, scaling automatically as needed.

**Batch Processing for Image and Data Processing** 

● When new product images are uploaded to Amazon S3, an S3 event can trigger a Lambda function to create a thumbnail or watermark for the images. The results are then stored back in S3 or in a database. 

● If the process involves multiple steps or needs to be retried in case of failure, the Lambda function can enqueue messages to SQS after each successful processing step. 

● Another Lambda function can poll SQS to process the next step, ensuring the pipeline runs smoothly and retries failed tasks if needed. This is especially useful for tasks that require scalability and resilience.

**Retry Mechanism for Failed Processes** 

● With SQS, we can implement a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) for failed messages that couldn’t be processed by Lambda after multiple attempts. 

● The DLQ can store these failed messages for later inspection, allowing for improved troubleshooting and resolution. 

● Another Lambda function could monitor the DLQ, sending alerts to the operations team or attempting re-processing based on defined logic.

**Scaling Microservices with Event-Driven Processing** 

● For specific business logic, such as handling abandoned shopping carts or promotional notifications, SQS can queue these events based on user interactions or time-based triggers. 

● Lambda functions can poll the queue to process these events, adding further scalability without overloading the main application backend.
